## day8 - Sets and Dictionary

#####     Sets     #####
    #Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
    # They are useful when you want to eliminate duplicates and perform common set operations like union,
    # intersection, and difference. Since sets are unordered, items do not have a fixed position and
    # cannot be accessed using an index.

#Create a Set: Define a set with multiple elements, including duplicates,
    # and observe how duplicates are automatically removed.
#Add and Remove Items: Use add() to insert elements and remove() or discard() to delete them.
#Set Operations: Learn how to perform mathematical set operations like union(), intersection(),
    # and difference().
#Loop Through a Set: Use a loop to iterate over the elements in a set.

#####     Dictionary    #####
    # Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
    # They allow you to associate a unique key with a value, making them ideal for looking
    # up data efficiently. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any type.

#Create a Dictionary: Define a dictionary with keys and corresponding values (e.g., name-age pairs).
#Access Values: Use a key to retrieve the associated value using square brackets or the get() method.
#Update and Add Items: Modify existing key-value pairs or add new ones.
#Remove Items: Use methods like pop() or del to remove entries from the dictionary.
#Loop Through a Dictionary: Iterate through keys, values, or both using a for loop with .items(),
# .keys(), or .values().
