## day7 - Lists and Tuples

####    Lists   ####
#Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. 
#They are ordered and mutable, which means you can change their content after creation.
# Lists can store any type of data - strings, numbers, or even other lists.
# This makes them powerful and flexible for a wide range of tasks.

# *Create a List: Start by creating a list with 5 elements.
    # These could be fruits, numbers, or a mix of data types.
# *Access Elements: Use both positive and negative indices to retrieve items from the list.
# *Modify the List: Learn how to append, insert, remove, or update elements using built-in methods.
# *Slice the List: Use slicing to create sublists by selecting a specific range of elements.
# *Iterate Through the List: Use loops (like for or while) to go through each item and
    # perform operations on them.

#####     Tuples    #####
#Tuples are also ordered collections, just like lists, but with one key difference - they are immutable.
    # Once a tuple is created, you can't change its content.
    # Tuples are ideal when you want to store data that should not be altered, like coordinates,
    # configuration settings, or fixed values.

# *Create a Tuple: Define a tuple containing different types of data, such as strings,
    # numbers, or booleans.
# *Access Elements: Retrieve elements using index positions, just like you would with a list.
# *Tuple Operations: Perform operations like concatenation (+) and repetition (*),
    # or check membership with in.
# *Convert to a List: If you need to modify the tuple, convert it into a list, make the changes,
    # and convert it back if needed.
